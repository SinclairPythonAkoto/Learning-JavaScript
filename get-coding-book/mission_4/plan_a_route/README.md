# Plan A Route #

We will use a web API & Google Maps to embed content into a webpage and plan a route through Moscow - from Gorky Park to St Basil's Cathedral.

Must include the following:
- Use an API key: Google Maps Embed API to get an API key.
- Create an `<iframe>`: to embed content in your page.
- Change the way the `<iframe>` displays.
- Use the source attribute.
- Use the Google Maps Embed API to create a Google Map.
- Use the built-in direction function to plan a route.
- Set query string parameters to give the destination function the origin and destination for the route.
