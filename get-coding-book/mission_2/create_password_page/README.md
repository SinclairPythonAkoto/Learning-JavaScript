# Creating A Password Page #

We will create a password page using the skilled learned from **Mission 2**.  We will use functions, conditional logic and variables to create a webpage that prompts the user to enter a password.  If the user gets the password right they will get acess to the webpage built in *Mission 1*.

Must include the following:
- A function that will check the password when it is called.
- Varaibles that will store the value of the data the user enters into the password box.
- An if statement that will check if the password the user enters is correct.
- A text box th euser can enter data into.
- A hyper link that connects this webpage to the Monk Diamond Discovery webpage.
