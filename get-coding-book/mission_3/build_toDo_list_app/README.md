# Build A To-Do List App #

We will create a to-do list app that uses the JavaScript DOM & localStorage API.  The purpose of the app is to enable the user to create multiple tasks and then delete them once they have been completed.

Must include the following:
- A function that adds an item.
- A function that removes an item from the list, using the DOM.
- A function that saves the list, using localStorage.
- A function that loads the list, using localStorage.
- A text box the user can type the item into.
- A button that the user can click to add an item to the list.
