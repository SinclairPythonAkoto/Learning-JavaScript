For this project we will make a basic **CRUD** *(create, read, update, delete)* web app using just JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

This web app will alllow the user to create an employee name, along with criterias such as their salary and city, and will have the ability to update and delete the entries as they please.

Once we learn the concept of making a basic crud app we can then craete more intricate web apps, and even create one using a ***database***.
