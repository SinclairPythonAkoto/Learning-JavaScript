# Variables #

Variables like in many programming languages are essentially *containers that hold data/values that can be accessed in other parts of the code by calling its name*.  They make it really easy to write complex programs with lots and lots of instructions, and keep everything organized and straight.

**Variables are containers where we can store pieces of data we want to work with in our programs.**

Lets look at the code below, we will create the same in the `.js` file.
```
document.write("There once was a man named George <br/>");
document.write("He was 70 years old <br/>");
document.write("He really liked the name George <br/>");
document.write("But didn't like being 70 <br/>");
```
*The difference is that we will create variabes for the name and age, which will allow us to manipulate and change the values of the variables as we please.*

**REMEMBER!!**

It's better to have a variable name that's long and descriptive (even though it might take more time to type out), than one that's just a single letter or confusing!
