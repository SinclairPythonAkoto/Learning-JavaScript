# Building A Basic Messaging App #

In this section we will build a basic messaging app where the user can write some text and then get it displayed back to the on the webpage.

#### Objectives ####
- Create 3x variables for the HTML elements we wish to interact with
- Add an event listener on the `button` variable so that we can execute a function when the button is clicked.
- Inside the the function create a new variable (`newMessage`) where we will store the user input into a list.  To do this we will have to use the `createElement` method.
- Add text in the new variable with `innerHTML`.
- Use `appendChild` to append the user text into the unordered list tag.
- Clear the user input box every time a new entry is made.
