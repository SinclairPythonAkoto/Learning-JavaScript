This turtorial runs through the basics of JavaScript.

JavaScript has become one of the three core web development along-side HTML & CSS.

Because javascript is a core web development technology and most web developers know it, Javascript has been stretched beyond it’s original purpose. Now-a-day’s there are thousands of javascript frameworks and it’s even used as a server-side language.

Javascript utilizes a garbage collector and it’s syntax is loosly based on C/C++.

I am using Vim to create my JavaScript files.
