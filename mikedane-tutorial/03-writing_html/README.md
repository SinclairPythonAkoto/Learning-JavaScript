# Writing HTML #

Not only can we create instructions for our HTML file, but we can also write HTML within our JavaScript file.

We will print out a silmple `Hello World` statement as a header along with a simple shape, but in reality this enables us to create some complex functions within the websites / programs we will eventually create.
