# Hello World #

Creating an alert box that reads *'Hello World'* within the webpage.

In this file we have created the JavaScript commands within within the HTML page.  When doing this we have to set the `type` within the script tag to `text/javascript`.  

This allows us to create the alert box by using `alert()` and also write onto the screen by using `document.write()`.
